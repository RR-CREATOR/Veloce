PS: its still pretty empty, gonna be adding stuf soon

# **Day 1**

Research on feasibility, ideas, premade projects, and deciding goals, along with basic planning

Goals: 
- Piezo sensors for z adjustment
- Can print pla, petg and tpu
- Speed >300 mm/s
- Build volume >=25cm^3

Read up, watched many videos on how i could start with the design and building

Time: 4 hrs

# **Day 2**

Figured out the basic design pattern i would follow, the various items i would need
Did some feasibility research and figured out if my ideas would work
Decided on a frame and structure, gonna figure out the tech parts of the BOM soon

- Made design sketches, and found build plate and heatbed.
- Also decided to use an aluminium plate bw the bed and pla support.
- Also found rods, screws and decided on nema 17 motors.
- Started with the BOM, although a lot of work is still to be done.

*The plates are 310x310 mm, so thinking of keeping build volume around 300mm^3*

Time: 8 hrs

# **Day 3**

Worked further on my BOM

Figured out a way to prevent pla warping, but still pretty sure gonna print PETG for parts
Also, found hotend and extruder. A BGM clone and a creality clone. Figured out hotend design as well, just the tech parts and psu is left.
Should be able to get around 300mm/s speed. Soon gonna add the BOM.
Honestly, finding parts has been supr painful. Lik srsly why are chinese stores banned in india :(.
Gonna be using a boden setup, as dont really need to print flexible mats.

Time: 5 hrs (lik srsly, it took sooo long to find any good items)


***Total Time: 17 hrs***
