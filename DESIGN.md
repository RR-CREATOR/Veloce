# **Day 1**

Research on feasibility, ideas, premade projects, and deciding goals, along with basic planning

Goals: 
- Piezo sensors for z adjustment
- Can print pla, petg and tpu
- Speed >300 m/s and accel >6 m/s^2
- Build volume >=25cm^3

Read up, watched many videos on how i could start with the design and building

Time: 4 hrs

# **Day 2**

Figured out the basic design pattern i would follow, the various items i would need
Did some feasibility research and figured out if my ideas would work
Decided on a frame and structure, gonna figure out the tech parts of the BOM soon

- Made design sketches, and found build plate and heatbed.
- Also decided to use an aluminium plate bw the bed and pla support.
- Also found rods, screws and decided on nema 17 motors.
- Started with the BOM, although a lot of work is still to be done.

*The plates are 310x310 mm, so thinking of keeping build volume around 300mm^3*

Time: 8 hrs


***Total Time: 12 hrs***
