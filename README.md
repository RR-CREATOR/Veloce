# Veloce

3D-printer focusing on speed, size and quality, for rapid prototyping

Hopefully it works well.

I want this printer to be fully upgradeable. I want it so as new and new innovations come out, I can just replace the parts and make it better and up to date.
So made the printer around that.

The name Veloce means speed, which is my goal.
To that extend, I tried to modify the design to minimise resistance of moving parts :p
